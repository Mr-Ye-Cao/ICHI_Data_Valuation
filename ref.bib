abstract={This paper investigates the emergence of Theory-of-Mind (ToM) capabilities in large language models (LLMs) from a mechanistic perspective, focusing on the role of extremely sparse parameter patterns. We introduce a novel method to identify ToM-sensitive parameters and reveal that perturbing as little as 0.001{\%} of these parameters significantly degrades ToM performance while also impairing contextual localization and language understanding. To understand this effect, we analyze their interactions with core architectural components of LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that these sensitive parameters are closely linked to the positional encoding module, particularly in models using Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), where perturbations disrupt dominant frequency activations critical for contextual processing. Furthermore, we show that perturbing ToM-sensitive parameters affects LLMs' attention mechanism by modulating the angle between queries and keys under positional encoding. These insights provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs acquire social reasoning abilities, bridging AI interpretability with cognitive science.},
